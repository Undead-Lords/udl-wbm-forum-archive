# wbm-udl-forum-archive

---

This repo is to duplicate the way back machine archive of our forum history at `undeadlords.net` and to create itemized timestamp records that we can use to show record keepers and the general public our expansive history as a guild.

---

Contribution guidelines:

- YYYYMMDD is the date format we use here.
- log backups are saved html documents of those wbm snapshots, they need to be compressed.
- timestamps are screenshots of those snapshots
- timestamps should be named YYYYMMDD.png, if that day is already logged and there's a new log of another part of the forum, use YYYYMMDDboardname.png
- We don't only archive images and html backups, our primary goal is to log evidence of EVERY instance of forum activity.
- That being said, each snapshot usually has 4 to 8 records of activity. I want each logged. 
- No need to add them to the csv, I'll do that programmatically.  
- If you don't understand how to generate entries for the records.json file, ask barri about alternative ways of logging.  
- Please let us know you are working on a particular year in issues on the github repo for this project
- If there are multiple people working on the same year, specify the month.  
- Label each Year/Month completed on the calendar.md
- PLEASE don't work in `main` or branch. Use `git checkout [yourBranchNameGoesHere]`. 
- Don't merge to `main`.
- Submit a pull request. Ask Barri how or [look here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
- We have an example template, use it.
- Any questions at all, ask Barri
